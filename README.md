build 4 models in many algorithm for  guess the correct author if given a tweet of unknown author
/* 
In this project, we are trying to understand how machine learning for classification works, so
we start by a data set that was provided for us by the instructor, and then try different classification
algorithms on this data set, and check the results, so that we can compare the result and see which
algorithm works best in building a prediction model for our data
